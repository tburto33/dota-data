Welcome to my DotaData project. I play a lot of a game called DoTA2 in my spare time. It is a very complex game that requires a wide knowledge base to be good at.
After discovering an API called OpenDota I found it contained lots of data for the game everyday players don't get to see.
As a small project I have pulled some of the data to use while I learn how to manipulate that data using:
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- MatPlotLib
- Requests
- Postman

I am hoping I can use it to help myself improve not only while playing the game, but to extend my coding knowledge as well.
